This is the text file that will be overwritten with the formula for the drawing every time the program runs. The formula is in the form (x(t), y(t)) and is the kind of thing you can copy/paste into Desmos or some other graphing calculator (make sure the bounds are at least 2pi apart else you won't get the full graph of the drawing).
